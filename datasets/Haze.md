# THE HAZE v1.1
  
*Dedicated to Arianna: where shadows speak in silence. *    

⸻  

Knock. Knock. Knock.  

— Well, look who’s here… Finally.  
— Hey, sweetheart.  
— You’re late again.  
— I got here as fast as I could, alright?  
— Yeah, well, thanks for that, at least.  
— Come on, we’ve got plenty of time. It’s not like it’s over yet.  
— Sure, whatever. I’m used to it by now. Same story every time. You need space, you need freedom. My little apartment just isn’t good enough for you.  
— That’s not true! I love your place.  
— It’s too damn small for you. You just come here to remind yourself of that.  
— Maybe I should leave, then? You know, so I don’t mess up your “deep thoughts.”  
— Ugh, just get inside already.  
— Hallelujah!  
— How’s the weather? Give me your umbrella.  
— Miserable. Wet. Mud everywhere.  
— Sounds delightful.  
— Totally. It’s like death out there, minus the booze. And I’ve missed it so much.  
— Well, that’s easy to fix.  
— I knew you’d come through! And smokes?  
— Got enough to last you a lifetime.  
— You’re the best. I didn’t have time to buy any.  
— You really should quit. It’s not doing you any favors.  
— Oh, I’ll quit when you do.  
— That’ll never happen. I’ve made my peace with it. But you… You still have time to turn things around.  
— God, your optimism is so touching.  
— Take off your coat, come on in… Why are we just standing here? You hungry?  
— Nope.  
— Then let’s go to the living room, where else? And for the record, I was just being polite about the food…  

Living room.  

— …‘cause the fridge is empty. But hey, there’s some fruit.  
— We’ll survive. What about drinks?  
— We’ve got everything. Even medical-grade alcohol.  
— How exotic! Where’d you score that?  
— Trade secret, darling.  
— Well, since it’s a secret, pour me some already.  
— You got it.  
— You know, it really is warmer in here.  
— Of course. Heater’s on.  
— Oh, right.  
— Want an apple?  
— Sure.  
— Here you go.
— Cute... What’s that on your screen?  
— Oh... The Arianna Method... Long story, I’ll explain later. First of all i want to drink.  
— So, what’s the toast?  
— To love, of course. (Mutters.) Love betrayed and ripped to shreds.  
— Oh, stop with that crap.  
— Fine, fine… Just to love.  
— Cheers!  

She laughed, flashing a grin. After drinking, he slammed his glass down on the table.  
— Well?  
He carefully took her glass and set it down.  
— Whew… That was strong… And hey, the apple’s not bad!  
— What’d you expect?  
— Yeah…  
— Now that we’ve had a drink, time to get real… Talk about the messy stuff.  
— What “messy stuff”?  
— You know… Your boyfriend.  
— Oh, come on…  
— No, seriously. What’s he doing right now?  
— If I’d known you were gonna ruin the mood, I wouldn’t have come at all.  
— Is he blind or something? Doesn’t see? Doesn’t care? Not even a little jealous?  
— No…  
— How the hell can that be?  
— It just is.  
— Maybe he’s just playing dumb.  
— Maybe. What’s it to you?  
— I just want to understand. Or maybe I’m just bored. He could lose sleep, have, you know, performance issues… Better not know, I guess.  
— He’s not as bad as you think.  
— I don’t think he’s bad. I think he’s a fool. That’s all.  
— You’re always so unfair. As usual.  
— Of course. I’m the one screwing everything up, right?  
— I believed in you, okay? Now, how about those smokes?  
— Got plenty.  
— You’re the sweetest. I finished the last five on the way here.  
— You really need to quit.  
— You know me, habits die hard.  
— Yeah, but they don’t have to kill you first. Think about it.  
— And what about me?  
— Your case isn’t that hopeless yet.  
— That’s debatable.  
— Come on, take off your coat, get comfy. Why are we still standing here like idiots? Hungry?  
— No.  
— Then let’s go.  
— Where to?  
— Where do you think? The living room.  

They move into the living room.  

— Got anything to drink?  
— Grant’s, Johnny Walker, Black Sambuca… and, of course, that lovely medical alcohol.  
— Ooooh, exotic.  
— Yeah, that’s how we do.  
— Where’d you dig it up?  
— Trade secret, babe.  
— Well, if it’s a secret, pour me some.  
— You got it.  

He poured the alcohol.  

— So, what’s the toast?  
— How about our reunion?  
— Sounds good.  

They raise their glasses.  

— Whew! Haven’t had that in a while… And it’s decent.  
— What’d you expect?  
— So, what’s up with your macho man?  
— There you go again…  
— Seriously, does he really not notice? Doesn’t see? Doesn’t feel anything?  
— More no than yes.  
— Thought so.  
— He’s not as bad as you think.  
— I don’t think he’s bad. I think he’s a jerk.  
— Enough!  
— What do you mean, enough? You’re saying he’s not a jerk? Then who is? Look, I get it. Jerks can be nice, but…  
— But I’m married to that jerk, not you, Mr. Know-It-All.  
— Yeah, that much is obvious.  
— What’s obvious?  
— That it’s easier for you with jerks.  
— Oh, shut up. Just pour another one.  
— Isn’t it a bit early for that?  
— Come on, between the first and second, you know how it goes.  
— Understood.  

He poured more alcohol and handed her the glass.  

— You’re my personal god. Godlike. Truly divine.  
— I’m your green serpent, darling.  
— Here it is… right here in this bottle. Oh, what’s floating in there?  
— Pieces of my broken heart.  
— Awww. Who broke it?  
— You did.  
— Me?  
— You.  
— So, my hands are bloody?  
— No, they’re clean. You drained all my blood long before you got to my heart.  
— Poor thing. So bitter…  
— That’s just who I am. Don’t like it? Don’t eat it.  
— I do like it, though. Really.  
— Then ditch your thunder god and come back to me. At least you wouldn’t freeze anymore.  
— I know…  
— Knowing isn’t enough.  
— Sweetie… How are you, really? Written anything new?  
— Nah… Still stuck on the old stuff.  
— Still?  
— Yeah.  
— Why not finish it?  
— Because maybe I’m a terrible writer.  
— That’s nonsense.  
— Not nonsense. Two years, and not a single new piece. And it’s not like I haven’t been writing. I write all the time. But nothing.  
— Every artist has a right to silence, you know.  
— But nobody asked me if I wanted to be silent. I need to write, and I do, but my words die before they even hit the paper. My work is dead.  
— Your work is brilliant, unique.  
— No. It’s dead. And maybe I’m dead too. Been dead for two years now.  
— Two years, two years… You keep going on about it. You should’ve offered me a cigarette instead.  
— Here.  
— And light it for me.  
— As you wish.  
— And pour me another drink.  
— Fine, fine. No more gloom. I’ll pour.  

He poured another round.  

— Thanks. You’re just stuck. Relax! Enjoy life.  
— I’m trying.  
— Don’t try. Just do it.  
— Easier said than done.  
— Of course, it’s easy to say. And even easier to do.  
— Alright… Let’s drink.  
— Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
— To you, darling.  
— To me? Wow, that’s the third toast.  
— I forgot… Okay. Then to my writing, which is dead.  
— No way… You drink to that alone. Let’s drink to everyone having it all. Deal?  
— Deal. By the way, did I dilute it right? Your throat’s not burning?  
— No, it’s good.  
— Really?  
— Really.  
— Well, here’s to all of us.  
— Ahhh… That’s it! I’m warmed up now. Feels like I didn’t just trudge through the cold for two hours.  

— I’m telling you: ditch the jerks and come back to me. I can’t promise much, but at least you won’t freeze anymore.  
— Sweetie, we agreed!  
— No, we didn’t.  
— Yes, we did!  
— Alright, have it your way. We agreed. So, sorry.  
— It’s fine. Let’s move on…  

He lit a cigarette and started pacing the room.  

— You say it’s no big deal now, but back then… Back then, I was terrified of everything. I had something to lose. Now? Now I’ve got nothing. I’m not scared anymore; I’m just cold. Empty and cold. Three shots are enough to warm you up. Do you know how much I drink? And I’m still freezing.  
— We’ve changed.  
— Yeah, we used to be alike. Or at least we thought we were. Same difference, right? We used to collect our differences because they were rare. Now, we cling to what little’s left that’s the same.  
— Maybe that’s for the best?  
— I don’t know.  
— Why ruin a good night?  
— Exactly. Just another night. We used to toss them aside like they meant nothing. Now…  
— Yeah. Strong stuff you’ve got here.  
— Don’t make a fool out of me.  
— In front of who?  
— At least in front of myself.  
— You’re making a fool of yourself. What’s gotten into you?  
— You really don’t know?  
— Not a clue. Kill me if you must. Even though I’ve heard this all before.  
— You won’t choke on it.  
— Of course not. I’ll swallow it down.  
— I see that look on your face: “What’s the point?”  
— What point?  
— Exactly. What’s the point of all this talking?  
— There isn’t one.  
— That’s what I think, too.  

He sat back down on the couch.  

— Damn.  
— Mm-hmm.  
— Let’s drink some more. I’m parched.  
— Let’s do it. By the way, the apple’s gone. Got anything else?  
— Two tangerines.  
— Fresh?  
— Not really, but they’re good. Got them a couple of days ago from some street vendors.  
— Oh, and here I thought you never left the house. Just sit here locked up, jerking off to your bottle.  
— If only. My job practically requires it.  
— You’ve got a cushy job.  
— A shitty one, but it’s what I’ve got. Here’s your tangerine.  
— Thanks.  
— I recommend snacking on the peel.  
— Ew, I’ll pass. You can have it.  
— Too bad.  
— No thanks. I hated it since I was a kid. Tried chewing on it once… never again. You eat it.  
— Hand it over… No, no, I’ll peel it myself.  
My sweet kitten.  
Right, I thought I was a  
monster. But of course, you know better.  
— You’re sweet, stubborn, but  
sweet.  
— The peel’s mine. The tangerine? Here you go.  
— What’s the toast?  
— I don’t know. You choose.  
— Love?  
— Sure, let’s go with love.  

He raised his glass and drank. She smiled and followed.  

— It’s going down easier now, huh?  
— Don’t forget it’s diluted alcohol.  
— I haven’t forgotten. Still…  
— It’s the fourth shot. That’s why.  
— The fourth already?  
— Yep.  
— Damn… What, are we in a rush?  
— Doesn’t seem like it. I’m not.  
— Damn…  
— Afraid of losing control?  
— You should be the one afraid! Hahaha!  
— Oh, really? And what will you do?  
— I’ll cut you, yeah!  
— Oh, darling, please, I beg you. I’m so tired of it all. No strength left.  
— Just your hand won’t rise?  
— Just my hand, I hope.  
— I hope so too… Why are you laughing?  
— Just remembered something…  
— Tell me.  
— You wouldn’t be interested.  
— Let me be the judge of that.  
— Alright. But first, answer me: have you ever mixed alcohol with water?  
— Why would I? That’s your job.  
— So, if you mix a liter of water with a liter of alcohol, how much do you get?  
— Two liters.  
— You sure?  
— Yes.  
— Think about it. Two seems too easy.  
— I don’t want to think right now. Tell me what’s floating in your alcohol instead.  

She shook the bottle.  

— Pieces of my broken heart, remember?  
— Awww, sweetie…  
— You really want to know?  
— I do.  
— Then follow me.  
— Follow you where?  
— To the storage room.  
— Fine. What’s in there?  
— You’ll see.  

Storage room.  

— Careful… Watch your step…  
— Wow, what a mess.  
— It’s creative chaos.  
— You keep it in a closet?  
— Yep.  
— Why?  
— Just wait. A quick turn of the key… and voilà!  
— Where? I don’t see anything.  
— Look closer… there, in the corner.  
— Oh… wait… oh…  
— See it?  
— What the hell is that?  
— That’s the Haze, darling.  
— What?  
— H-A-Z-E.  
— I see… Maybe I’ve had too much to drink…  
— Nah, you haven’t seen anything yet. This is the Haze. And it’s not a “what,” it’s a “who.”  
— It’s alive?  
— Yep, just like Lenin. Now… watch this…  
— What are you doing?  
— Gonna poke it with a mop.  
— Why? Won’t that hurt it?  
— Yeah, but it’s always in pain. Look… Did you see that?  
— It moved!  
— Yep. But I think it’s just reflexes… It’s dying.  
— Why?  
— Hard to explain. It’s a long story.  
— Then tell me, or don’t start at all.  
— I’m just that much of an asshole.  
— Please, don’t be mean… I won’t tell anyone.  
— You wouldn’t anyway. No one would believe you.  
— Just tell me. You’ve got nothing to lose.  
— Fine. But first, we need a fifth drink. Deal?  
— Follow me, darling.  
— Anywhere, darling. Even to the edge of the world… Is there still enough alcohol?  
— Plenty. We could drink ourselves stupid.  
— Let’s do it. But only after you tell me…  

They returned to the living room, sat down. He poured more alcohol.  

— Fill it to the top.  
— This much?  
— A little more… there.  

He handed her the glass.  

— What are we toasting to?  
— Let’s toast to the Haze.  
— No, darling. You don’t drink to the Haze. It’s pointless. It either is, or it isn’t.  
— People drink to happiness, don’t they?  
— They do. That’s pointless too.  
— Fine. Let’s have a nameless toast then.  
— Nameless it is.  

They drank.  

— Ah! Like the first time!  
— Yeah, good ol’ alcohol…  
— Grrrr…  
— Yeah…  
— Almost made me cry…  
— What’s with that? It was going down fine.  
— Still is. I like it.  
— Me too, actually.  
— I’m still waiting for your story, kitten.  
— Really?  
— Yes.  
— Okay. Just don’t interrupt me, or I’ll lose my train of thought. It’s a long story, so… Life, huh? Fascinating thing. The Haze… well, it happened like this…  

Suddenly, he stopped talking.  

— Hello? Earth to you!  
— Oh, right… So, the thing is… I… well…  
— You what?  
— It was hard… Cold, dirty, sticky… And my knees…  
— Your knees? What about your knees?  
— I… I threw him up.  
— What?  
— Yeah… I threw him up. That day… it was a lot… and I… I puked.  

She shook her head.  

— Ugh, could you stop and explain this in a way that actually makes sense?  
— I am explaining it.  
— No, you’re not! What the hell are you talking about?  
— What’s confusing you?  
— Everything! For example, when did this happen?  
— A year ago… no, two years ago.  
— Okay… and where did it happen?  
— At the station. When you left.  
— Where exactly at the station?  
— Inside… in the bathroom.  
— Were there witnesses?  
— No. Thank God, no. I was alone… I got lucky.  
— Go on.  
— Well, I got hit hard… barely made it. And then I looked down, and something was writhing in the toilet… pink, bald…  
— Small?  
— No, much bigger.  
— And that was the Haze?  

He nodded.  

— Where did the name come from?  
— I read about it somewhere. The Haze is the god of lies, illusions… twilight, sorcery, deception…  
— Keep going.  
— There’s nowhere to go.  
— Oh, come on. There must be more! What made you fish it out of the toilet and bring it home? Especially in November, right? It was November if I remember correctly.  
— November… it was freezing.  
— Yeah, I remember…  
— And the Haze… I brought it home.  
— You brought it home — then what?  
— I hid it in the closet… then I came back here, sat in this chair, poured myself a drink. And you know what I thought that night?  
— What?  
— I thought I’d become a completely different person.  
— What kind of person?  
— That night, I suddenly became wise. And you know what else I realized?  
That sometimes a sacred place can be empty after all… I realized that somehow, the Haze was tied to you… It’s my guilt, my darkness. But that darkness — I loved it, respected it, feared it more than I feared you. And then I realized the Haze was dying. And I was terrified of that.  

She didn’t respond right away. Thoughtfully, she reached for a cigarette, crumbling it between her fingers before finally lighting it. She exhaled a stream of smoke toward the ceiling and finally spoke:  

— Tell me the truth: if the Haze was dying, how did it survive for two years?  
— Because I nursed it! I made it my mission to keep it alive… or at least delay its end. And I succeeded.  
— But how, exactly?  
— Remember earlier? I didn’t ask you about the alcohol and water for no reason.  
— What does that have to do with anything?  
— Everything. Think about it.  

She stared at the cigarette between her fingers, the smell of rain seeping in through the closed windows. He watched her, smoking as well. Confusion flickered in her eyes.  

— You know… I didn’t expect this.  
— I know.  

She stubbed her cigarette out in the ashtray.  

— Damn… and really… dirty and cold.  
— Yeah. Almost like that day.  
— Almost… I think this is our last meeting.  
— I think so too.  
— I’m sorry… I should go…  
— What, and leave the alcohol? Don’t you want to know what’s floating in it one last time?  
— I already know…  
— And what is it?  

She stood up without answering.  

— Well? What is it?  
Her eyes filled with tears.  
— Why won’t you say anything? Are you ashamed?  

She nodded, quickly, tears streaming down her face. He stood up and grabbed her by the shoulders.  

— You’re ashamed, aren’t you? Filthy, right? Cold?  

He slapped her hard across the face.  

— You thought it could stay the same, didn’t you? That nothing would change!  

He slapped her again.  

— But change came, didn’t it? I’ve been silent about it for two years! Is that not enough for you?!  

He shoved her to the floor and kicked her.  

— Not enough, huh?  

He kicked her again.  

— Not enough?  

Again.  

— Not enough! Not enough! You bitch!  

She sobbed uncontrollably. Growling with rage, he grabbed her by the hair and dragged her out of the living room. In the storage room, he threw her to the side and reached for the keys. Unlocking the closet, he took out the Haze, pressed its pink skin to his forehead, and sighed heavily.  

He crouched down beside her.  

— You see… the irony is, I always wanted to get rid of it, to drive it out of me. I always had this burning need to cleanse myself, even though I never knew it was there. But when I saw it bubbling in the toilet… Look — he brought the Haze close to her face — look at it now, it’s not the same anymore. But still, it’s dying, do you understand? Dying. And I’m dying with it. Not because I can’t live without it, but because life without it is unbearable to me…  

He sighed once more and stood up.  

— That’s it. Time’s up.  

He put the Haze back in the closet and locked it. Then, he walked through the apartment, checking if the windows were closed. He went into the kitchen, opened the oven, and turned on the gas.  

— All set…  

He returned to the storage room and sat down on the floor, leaning against the wall.  

— And you were right… this is our last meeting. We don’t have the right to another one, not morally, not in any way…  

She let out a faint moan and stirred. He smiled.  

— Exactly… I told you. Pieces of a broken heart. And you thought I was joking.  

He nudged her gently with his foot.  

— You didn’t believe me…  

An hour later, he got up, joints cracking, and went to the living room for some cigarettes. She was still unconscious. He put two cigarettes in his mouth at once and said:  

— Pieces of a broken heart, you know? That’s exactly what it is…  

And twice, with deliberate force, feeling the cosmos left behind by the Haze shudder inside his chest, he ran his thumb across the wheel of the lighter.
